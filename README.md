## Overview of Project

### Purpose

In this project we are helping Maria by doing analysis of all the reading and math tests by all the schools in her district. The analysis was done on the data she gave us from a csv file and was presented to her with a breakdown per school. Later on she found out that there was some academic dishonesty by the 9th grade class of Thomas High School. So she told us because of that we need to exclude all of the grades from the 9th grade of that high school in our analysis.

The purpose of this project is to learn how to manipulte a data set that we have worked with and rerun our analysis. This will provide more accurate data to the school board in the testing performance per school.

## Results
